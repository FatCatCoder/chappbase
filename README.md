# chappbase (Chat-App-Pocketbase)
A Realtime Chat App using Pocketbase, the cute open source firebase alt, fully self hosted and extendable as a framework "backend-as-a-service"

an experiment with BAAS tech as quick approach to getting up and running with a fully fledged app fit for small to mid tier scale

I've included the sqlite data files with some simple test stuff, it works just needs to be polished as if it were going to prod.


## Usage
```bash
./pocketbase serve
```

and then 

```bash
cd client && npm start
```

host anywhere with static file serving for the front end and for the backedn any app service which supports go or .exe
